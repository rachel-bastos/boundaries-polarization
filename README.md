# Boundaries polarization

This project consists on the implementation of an algoritm that calculaes a polarization measure for social media networks. It considers the relationship between nodes within community boundaries, going against the knowing modularity measure.

This algoritm was created by GUERRA (2013) and is methodologically defined in the article ["A Measure of Polarization on Social Media Networks Based on Community Boundaries"](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/ICWSM/ICWSM13/paper/viewPaper/6104).

## Execution

To calculate the polarization of a specific networkS, run:
```
 $ python network_polarization.py -p [folder-path] -l [log-path] -c [clusters-ids]
```
